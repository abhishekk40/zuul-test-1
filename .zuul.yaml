        # It is recommended to use the checks API for consistency with
        # other common CI tools that integrate with Github.  Results
        # will appear on the "checks" tab of PR and changes.  There is
        # generally no need to have Zuul leave comments when using the
        # checks API.

        # The older status API appears inline with the PR and can be
        # enabled by uncommenting the "status:" in the various
        # sections below.  You should choose one or the other
        # depending on project preferences.
